    <h1>Couple Basics about JS - Loops</h1>
    <div id="content">
        <p>There is couple types of loops in (not only) JavaScript.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>While loops</h2> <br>
        <p>While loop is a loop which is doing coded prgram until our conditions will be finished - check the .js file.</p> <hr>
        <h2>For Loops</h2> <br>
        <p>For loops - are used when we want to check defined staff as condition until they ends - good to use with arrays - check the .js file.</p> <hr>
        <h2>Do while Loops</h2> <br>
        <p>Do while loops - are used similar to while loops but firstly we need to declare what we need to do and later until when/while - check the .js file.
            The do while loops were used in really first versions now they are not used.
